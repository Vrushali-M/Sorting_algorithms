# Sorting_algorithms
Algorithm to get time required for mergesort, quicksort and insertion sort


- The algorithm takes input 'n' from user to ask for the number of integers to be sorted.
- It randomly generates n integers and sorts them.
- The modified quicksort uses insertion sort to sort numbers below 10.
